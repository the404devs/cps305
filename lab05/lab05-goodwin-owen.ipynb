    "To be honest, the only real difference is the call to ``resize()`` at the start, to decide whether we should resize the table. That's all we needed to do anyways. I did end up spending a good chunk of time trying to figure out why the value that triggered the resize ended up in the wrong spot while all others were fine, until I realised I had been determining the ``hashvalue`` before calling ``resize()``, effectively determining the new element's position in the old table, and putting it there in the new table. Swapping the first two lines fixed that real quick."
